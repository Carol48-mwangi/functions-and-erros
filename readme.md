# ShipmentTracking Smart Contract

This Solidity program is a simple ShipmentTracking contract that demonstrates the basic operations and functionality related to order tracking within a supply chain using Solidity. The purpose of this program is to illustrate how smart contracts can be used to manage the lifecycle of orders from placement to delivery, providing transparent and verifiable state changes on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This program is a contract written in Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. It handles order placement, status updates to shipped and delivered, and allows for cancellation under certain conditions. Each function demonstrates how to enforce permissions and ensure order integrity, making it a practical introduction to more complex supply chain management scenarios in decentralized applications.

## Getting Started

### Executing the program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Visit the Remix website at [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `ShipmentTracking.sol`).

3. Copy and paste the smart contract code provided above into the new file.

4. To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.0" or above, then click on the "Compile ShipmentTracking.sol" button.

5. Once the code is compiled, deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ShipmentTracking" contract from the dropdown menu, then click on the "Deploy" button.

6. Interact with the deployed contract by using the functions provided in the "Deployed Contracts" section of Remix.
